Hello!

My goals for this project are simple: to make my
life easier when I want search my favorite streaming sites,
like Netflix, HBONow, Amazon Prime, and so on. I have
frequently been annoyed when I have to go through every
site individually to search for something, and websites
I found which claimed to serve this function usually
disappointed me.

This will face some challenges to get past a very simple
application. I plan to tackle these as time goes on, but at
the moment, it is best for me to nail down the basic
functionality. The challenges, as far as I can see at this
point, are, in no particular order:

1. Responding to situations when the program encounters a
   site that is not currently logged into (i.e. the user
   needs to sign in).

2. Making the program into a webapp (mostly an issue with
   my lack of web development experience, which will be
   faced in time).

3. Creating a GUI to make the application more user friendly.

4. Achieving better communication between the application
   and the streaming service it is interacting with.

5. Allowing users the choice of which services to check.

I'm sure more will be added, and (hopefully) removed.

Regardless, please enjoy the code!
